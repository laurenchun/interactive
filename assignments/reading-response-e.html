  On the Maya Lin text -

  I was thinking about the comparison of Maya Lin's Vietnam War memorial to an offline local website.  The memorial, which is situated within a cut piece of the earth, cannot be seen from a distance or at many angles. The memorial calls for the viewer to enter the space to interface with the memorial.  Like offline local websites that can only be accessed in specific spaces, the memorial can only be accessed in a specific geographical container.  The names of veterans listed on the memorial are the only information provided to the viewer-in a way, this information is like the site-specific data provided on offline local websites.
