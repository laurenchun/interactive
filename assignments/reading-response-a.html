    <h1>Reading response A</h1>
<br>
<b>Assignment:</b>
<br<br>
Read three texts:
<br>
<br><a href="http://veryinteractive.net/library/the-cobweb"> - Jill Lepore, "The Cobweb: Can the Internet Be Archived?"(2015)</a>
<br><a href="http://veryinteractive.net/library/jodi-s-infrastructure">- Alexander Galloway, "Jodi’s Infrastructure” (2016)</a>
<br><a href="http://spring2018-yale.veryinteractive.net/content/conversation2-reliability.pdf">- Conversation 2, "Reliability" (2017)</a>
<br><br>
Then, find a specific section of the conversation you're interested in. Copy and paste this section into your "reading-response-a.html" document, and use the appropriate HTML tags to render the text legible. Now, insert your own opinion or response by writing your name and what you'd say into the section. When you're done, make sure you link this from your class homepage.
